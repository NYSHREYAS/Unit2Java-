Java OOP Examples: Student Management & Method Overloading
This project demonstrates two key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java:

Managing Student Data using Constructors
Method Overloading to Handle Multiple Data Types 

1. Student Management Example
Overview : 
[The Student class is used to manage student information such as ] :

Roll Number
Gender
Name
Email ID
Features
Default Constructor: Allows manual assignment of values.
Parameterized Constructor: Initializes the student data directly


2. Method Overloading Example
Overview
[The Sample class demonstrates method overloading, where multiple methods with the same name (print) handle different data types]:

String
Integer
Double


#Key Concepts Covered
*Constructors: Default and parameterized for efficient data initialization.
*Method Overloading: Handling multiple data types with a single method name.
*Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Demonstrates code reusability and clean design.
